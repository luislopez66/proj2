# proj2: Rummy Game in Java

Rummy game implemented in Java

I consulted an article of GeeksforGeeks which helped me implement MyStack class.
The article's title is: How to Implement Stack in Java Using Array and Generics?
Its link is: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-implement-stack-in-java-using-array-and-generics/.

Also, I give credit to Carlos Juan Diaz and Andrea Nieves to modify Hand.java and Card.java.
